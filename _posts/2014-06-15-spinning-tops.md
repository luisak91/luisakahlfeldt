During a one week workshop
with Pedrita Studio sponsored
by Portuguese cork company
Amorim, participants had the
chance to explore and play with
cork.

Plagued by a wasp infestation we
were inspired by cork’s original
function of sealing containers.
Playing around with different
shapes and material combinations,
we created a set of playful lids
which turn into spinning tops when
not in use. Making use of cork’s
insulating properties the spinning
tops not only protected our drinks
from wasps but also kept them
cool.

In collaboration with Kimahni
Emsley.
