This project was born from the idea of finding new ways to alter the perception of a city and transforming the relationship to the familiar, every day life urban environment.

Inspired by the Situationist International and their ideas about urban wandering, aimless drifting and detached observation, I created a set of devices that encourage pedestrians to take off their predicatable paths and develop a new awareness of their surroundings.

Once the die is rolled, the user refers to the instructions booklet that tells him the method of travelling in order to get lost.
