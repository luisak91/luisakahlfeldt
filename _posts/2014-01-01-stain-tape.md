The brief, given by plastic packaging manufacturer Logoplaste, was to design an innovative laundry product and packaging.

Born from the observation that many young users are confused about what product to use for a certain kind of stain, I came up with the concept of stain
removing tape. I was interested in creating a stain removal product that would speak to a younger, less experienced user group. The StainTape kit consists
of differently coloured tape, indicating clearly which tape to use for what kind of stain.
