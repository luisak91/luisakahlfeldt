Inspired by Ernest Callenbachâ€™s 1975 novel Ecotopia that urges its readers to adopt a more sustainable mindset, Ecotopia was an installation during London Design Festival 2016 that showcased sustainable visions of leading scientists, designers and architects currently looking at climate change and sustainable solutions. The multi sensory exhibition design, using sight, sound and touch was designed in collaboration with Will Verity.

A lightweight framework of hanging screens displayed large illustrations of the experts visions. In addition, a floor of gravel supported grasses and ferns, plants that can reduce pollution as well a being used as building materials and food. The design provided a relaxing and calm contrast to the busy design fair, where people could contemplate a more sustainable future.
