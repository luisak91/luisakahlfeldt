The TEDxBrixton 2015 stage concept was designed in collaboration with designers and friends Harriet Dodds, Bruno Schillinger and Will Verity.

The design was based on the events theme ‘kaleidoscope’ and consisted of over 30 large colourful shapes surrounding the main stage. We interpreted and took inspiration from the sports hall the event was located in, as if viewed through a kaleidoscope. The shapes were directly taken from the overlapping sport fields markings on the halls’s floor and manifested in 3D. The visual repetition of colour and use of reflecting surfaces, resulted in a striking kaleidoscopic abstraction of the space.

Additionally we also designed the way finding and signage outside the event space.
