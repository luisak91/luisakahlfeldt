The theme of this years Designer in Residence program at the Bauhaus was ‘Mine,Yours,Ours - The new joy of sharing’. I was invited to come to the Bauhaus to research and develop my Open Kitchen Project further.
Dealing with the question around the influence that collaborative consumption exercises on product design, I adopted a more participatory design approach. Through a series of workshops, I invited local people and students from Dessau
and around, to take part in the design process. We researched modern households, different sharing contexts and explored which products are best suited to be shared. From these collaborative insights we developed the Mixer 3.0 - a modern kitchen utensil designed for sharing.
