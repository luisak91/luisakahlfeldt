Essential and precise in appearance, yet poetic in its way of framing the light.
The slim and seemingly weightless structure allows light to take centre stage. A small dimmer at the end of the cone enables the user to adjust light intensity depending on the desired atmosphere. Fitted with a long cable and a simple mounting mechanism, the wall luminaire can be effortlessly adjusted in height and position, making it flexible in use for any practical requirement.
Unit can add a subtle sculptural element to any domestic interior, while emitting diffused, indirect light.
