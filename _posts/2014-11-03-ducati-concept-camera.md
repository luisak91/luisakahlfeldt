The task was to design a compact, pocket size camera for Italian motorcycle brand Ducati. The emphasis was placed on the emotive, intangible qualities and values of a brand and how these are translated into a tangible object.

Inspired by the passionate, almost obsessive attachment between a racer and his bike, I created a camera that reflects upon this unique and intimate interaction. I was interested in materialising the transformation from a passion into a fetish, by looking at abstract concepts such as bondage and the idea of a second skin.
