The media village for the Biennale Interior in Kortrijk was designed in collaboration with Francesca Formenti and Will Verity. Its consisted of a seating area, a bookshop, magazine stands an dan exhibition area.
Our aim for the media space was to create a quiet, independent oasis within the busy trade fair, dividing it into semi private yet communal, interactive areas. A space where visitors can take a break, exchange ideas and get acquainted with the media partners of the fair.

The fundamental design elements all use standardised building materials such as structural plywood, metal stud work, corrugated plastic sheeting and off the shelf strip lighting. The goal was to construct a space from pre manufactured industrial components as a kit of parts, assembled on site.
