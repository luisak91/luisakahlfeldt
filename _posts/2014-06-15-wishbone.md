The challenge given was to design
a conceptual device to be used
by adults in the future, which
would provide accountability
and tangible benefits for
environmentally friendly behaviour.

Inspired by the ‘Quantified-Self’
movement, which is based on the
belief that collecting data about
oneself leads to self improvement,
my aim was to design a tracking
device that would tap into the
same motivational strategy.
Wishbone is an omnipresent
feature of daily life for the year
2030. In the future, living a more
sustainable, harmonious life will
not be a choice anymore, but a
necessity. Wishbone supports and
helps the wearer to make more
sustainable choices, by tracking
the wearers carbon footprint
throughout the day and indicating
it through an LED display.
Emerging technologies will make
it possible for the user to ‘grow’ a
unique bracelet from their DNA,
enhancing the close personal
bond formed between technology
and the body.
