            <h3>about me</h3>
            <p>Hello there! This is the online portfolio of Luisa Kahlfeldt. Born in Berlin, I graduated from Central Saint Martins in London with a BA(Hons) in Product Design. Here, I worked on independent design projects as well as collaborating with external clients, such as Italian lighting company <a href="http://www.luceplan.com/Site/index.php?intLangID=1">Luceplan</a>. During my studies, I gained practical experiences while working with <a href=http://www.aisslinger.de>Studio Werner Aisslinger</a> in Berlin. This summer, I spent three months as a <a href="http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/designers-in-residence.html">Designer in Residence at the Bauhaus in Dessau</a>, which invites young designers to deal with current design issues and engage creatively with the legacy of modernity. Back in London, I currently work as a designer for  <a href="http://barberosgerby.com/">BarberOsgerby</a>.</p>
            <p>Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.</p>
